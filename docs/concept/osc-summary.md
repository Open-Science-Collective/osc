# The Open Science Collective: A Sustainable Funding Model for Research Infrastructure

**Academic research increasingly depends on open-source tools, yet the sustainability of this critical infrastructure remains precarious.** A recent study revealed alarming vulnerability in human neuroscience software packages (EEGLAB, FieldTrip, BrainStorm, MNE-Python, SPM), where the loss of just one or two key maintainers could jeopardize entire research ecosystems. Despite their foundational importance, these tools operate without stable funding mechanisms, relying instead on volunteer efforts, sporadic grants, and institutional goodwill. **The Open Science Collective (OSC) aims to establish a transformative funding model** using **(1)** direct-cost percentage contributions and **(2)** usage-based allocation, focusing on maintenance funding, and **(3)** economies of scale.

**Our direct-cost funding stream** proposes an open-source platform cost approximately 0.1% of direct costs from research grants, creating a proportional relationship between open-source software and tool use and financial support. Researchers and institutions contribute to a dedicated sustainability fund without significantly impacting their research budgets, which addresses the fundamental sustainability gap that traditional time-limited grants cannot solve. **The maintenance-first approach** recognizes software upkeep as a legitimate scientific activity deserving dedicated resources, ensuring critical research infrastructure remains functional and secure even as development priorities shift. Established software with demonstrated usage receives guaranteed baseline funding, freeing maintainers from the constant grant-writing cycle for basic operations. **Shared professional services** create economies of scale by providing documentation, security, testing infrastructure, and community management resources across multiple projects, delivering expertise that individual software packages could not independently afford.

The OSC will operate through a non-governmental organization working in partnership with university Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs). This structure will manage fund management, establish transparent metrics for resource allocation (including downloads, citations, and mentions in grants/papers), and provide technical governance through representative committees. Established software packages will receive baseline maintenance funding proportional to their usage metrics, while competitive grants will support innovation and new tool development. The governance model emphasizes rapid decision-making with regular community input, avoiding bureaucratic bottlenecks while ensuring broad representation.

Implementation will begin with pilot partnerships at universities with established OSPOs, gradually expanding to additional institutions and funding agencies. This phased approach allows for refinement of metrics, governance processes, and resource allocation methodologies. **The OSC model fundamentally reframes how we value research infrastructure**, shifting from treating software as disposable products to recognizing them as essential scientific instruments requiring ongoing investment. By creating a feedback loop between software usage and support, we incentivize both quality maintenance and user-focused development.

The impact extends beyond software sustainability. By providing stable careers, the OSC will professionalize the research software engineering roles in the scientific enterprise. Researchers will benefit from more reliable, better documented, and more secure tools with reduced "technical debt" that currently hampers productivity. Universities will gain recognition for their contributions to research infrastructure, incentivizing institutional investment in open-source development. Funding agencies will see greater return on investment as software developed through grants remains viable long-term. Most importantly, **science itself will advance more efficiently** when researchers can build upon stable, well-maintained digital foundations rather than constantly reinventing tools or working with abandoned software.

The Open Science Collective represents a systemic solution to a systemic problem, ensuring that the digital infrastructure will be there for the future generations of researchers. By embedding support for open-source tools directly into the research funding ecosystem, we create sustainability without relying on volunteer labor or unpredictable funding cycles, ultimately accelerating scientific progress through reliable, accessible research tools.
