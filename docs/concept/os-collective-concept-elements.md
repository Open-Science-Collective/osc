# OS-Collective: A Sustainable Funding Model for Academic Open Source Software

## Executive Summary

OS-Collective proposes a revolutionary funding model for academic open source software through the establishment of a non-governmental organization that collects a small percentage (~0.1%) of direct costs from research grants to create a sustainable funding pool. This addresses the critical sustainability gap for essential research software infrastructure while encouraging best practices, innovation, and resource sharing.

## The Challenge

Academic open source software faces a fundamental sustainability crisis:
- Critical tools are often maintained by volunteers or through short-term grants
- Maintenance funding is scarce compared to development of new features
- Shared resources like documentation, security, and community management are underfunded
- Software sustainability planning is rarely incorporated into research grants

## Our Solution

**The Percentage-Based Funding Model:**
- Research grants contribute a small percentage (~0.1%) of direct costs to the collective fund
- Researchers identify which open source tools they use or plan to use in their proposals
- Usage metrics (downloads, citations, mentions in grants/papers) inform funding allocation
- Established software receives guaranteed maintenance funding proportional to usage
- Competitive grants support innovation and new software development

**Shared Resources and Services:**
- Centralized support for engineering, documentation, security, and community management
- Shared platforms and infrastructure reduce costs for individual projects
- Training and best practices guidance ensure software quality and accessibility
- Collaborative development of common tools and libraries

**Governance Structure:**
- Regional and university offices ensure broad representation
- Technical committees provide specifications and evaluate grant applications
- Fast, lean decision-making processes with regular community input
- Transparent metrics and allocation processes

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Initial Adoption:** Partner with university Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) and progressive funding agencies to pilot the model
2. **Transition Plan:** Integrate with existing grant systems through gradual adoption
3. **Scaling:** Expand to additional research domains and funding sources as the model proves successful

## Benefits

- **For Researchers:** Sustainable tools, better documentation, and reduced redundancy
- **For Software Maintainers:** Stable funding, professional development, and shared resources
- **For Universities:** Recognition for software contributions and competitive advantage
- **For Funding Agencies:** Greater impact from investments and reduced duplication

## Conclusion

The OS-Collective model transforms academic software funding from an afterthought to an integral part of the research ecosystem, ensuring that the digital infrastructure powering scientific discovery remains robust, accessible, and innovative for generations to come.
