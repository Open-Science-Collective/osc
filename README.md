# Open-Science Collecitve: Sustainable Funding for Academic Open Source

Open-Science Collecitve (OSC) aims to create a sustainable funding model for academic open source software through small percentage-based contributions from research grants.

## Vision

Our vision is to establish a non-governmental organization that:
- Collects a small percentage (starting at ~0.1%) of direct costs from research grants
- Distributes funding to open source projects based on usage metrics
- Provides shared resources for engineering, documentation, security, and community management
- Ensures sustainable maintenance funding for established software
- Supports innovation through competitive grant proposals

## Development Plan

1. **Phase 1: Concept Development** (Current)
   - Create detailed one-page concept document
   - Develop governance structure proposal
   - Define metrics for measuring software usage and impact

2. **Phase 2: Stakeholder Engagement**
   - Engage with university OSPOs (Open Source Program Offices)
   - Consult with existing funding organizations
   - Gather feedback from open source maintainers

3. **Phase 3: Model Refinement**
   - Create economic models and simulations
   - Refine funding distribution mechanisms
   - Develop transition plans for integrating with grant systems

4. **Phase 4: Pilot Implementation**
   - Identify partner institutions for initial implementation
   - Establish pilot program with limited scope
   - Measure outcomes and refine approach
